## General Information
   *  This repository was created because I was unable to use an access token instead of a password
      when pushing content from a local repository to the the remote GitHub repository. 
   *  I intended to delete the remote but then decided it may have a useful application. 
   *  The (Javascript file) script.js contains the issue/experience/solution to the problem.
   *  The intent is to provide data to anyone else who is using an access token for the first time
      and has encountered the same issue as I did.
   * I encountered a number of interrelated issues.
